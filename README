Scriptaculous Effect: Flicker
by Jake Wendt, 2007

Changes the visibility of a tag at relatively random intervals.


Options
=======

fps: 
	basically, how often to possibly switch the visibility

threshold:
	This number is used to compare against Math.random() to determine whether tag is hidden or visible.  Since Math.random() only returns a number between 0 and 1, it is kinda pointless to set this outside this range.  You probably want it somewhere between 0.25 and 0.75.
	(var visibility = ( Math.random() < this.options.threshold ) ? "hidden" : "visible";)
	n <= 0: tag will always be visible.
	n >= 1: tag will always be hidden.

endvisibility:
	kinda obvious


Example
=======

new Effect.Flicker('thisimg', {
	delay: 1, 
	fps: 10, 
	duration: 9999, 
	threshold: 0.3, 
	endvisibility: 'visible', 
	queue: 'end' 
});
